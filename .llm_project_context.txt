    * Actively use git, e.g. branching for continous development and utilise tags sensibly.
    * You, the llm, should actively add tests as often as possible.


Bugs:
- [ ] Graph header is showing first entry rather than most recent 
- [ ] Bottom of graph being cut off on mobile. Fixed by rotating landscape then back to portrait
- [ ] Body weight always saves as zero, I have been having to go into 'edit database' to take measurements.


Requests:
- [ ] Save what exercise was most recently input
- [ ] Always highlight body weight times reps on the graph
