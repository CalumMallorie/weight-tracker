LLM INSTRUCTIONS:
Actively use git, e.g. branching for continous development and utilise tags sensibly. Don't commit stuff to main randomly.
You, the llm, should actively add tests as often as possible.


Bugs:
- [x] Bottom of graph being cut off on mobile. Fixed by rotating landscape then back to portrait âœ… FIXED: Increased plot margins, adjusted font sizes, changed overflow to visible, and increased mobile plot heights
- [ ] Body weight always saves as zero, I have been having to go into 'edit database' to take measurements.


Requests:
- [ ] Persistance of selected exercise to plot
- [ ] A highlighted point on the graph should always show the date, reps, and weight, (or one of the two)
