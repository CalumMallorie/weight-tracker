LLM INSTRUCTIONS:
Actively use git, e.g. branching for continous development and utilise tags when main is updated meaningfully. Don't commit stuff to main randomly.
You, the llm, should actively add tests as often as possible.

TAGGING RULES:
- Create semantic version tags (v1.0.0, v1.1.0, v1.0.1) when merging to main
- Use MAJOR version for breaking changes or major new features
- Use MINOR version for new features and significant bug fixes
- Use PATCH version for small bug fixes and minor improvements
- Tag format: "v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}" with descriptive commit message
- Always tag after successful merge to main with comprehensive testing

Bugs:
- [x] Bottom of graph being cut off on mobile. Fixed by rotating landscape then back to portrait ✅ FIXED: Increased plot margins, adjusted font sizes, changed overflow to visible, and increased mobile plot heights
- [x] Body weight always saves as zero, I have been having to go into 'edit database' to take measurements. ✅ FIXED: Added validation to prevent zero weight for body mass entries, fixed test handling logic, and added comprehensive tests


Requests:
- [x] Persistance of selected exercise to plot ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Added localStorage persistence for selected exercise and processing type with 30-day expiration
- [x] A highlighted point on the graph should always show the date, reps, and weight, (or one of the two) ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Enhanced hover information to consistently show date, weight, and reps with improved formatting and larger markers
